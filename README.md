Our idea is to create an android application using cyber technology to achieve a save and secure society.
1. SOS feature --> which broadcast the victim's live location along with their profile detail, so other users will go and help them.
2. Domestic violence feature --> Upload proof of domestic violence directly to server , to avoid any loss of evidence.
3. Trafficking feature--> Report potential trafficking areas to the server which could be investigated by police later
